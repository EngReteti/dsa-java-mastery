# 🧠 DSA Java Mastery: 7-Day Logic Intensive

A systematic implementation of core Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. This repository serves as a technical laboratory for mastering memory management, pointer logic, and computational efficiency.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* **Efficiency**: Evaluating time and space complexity using Big O notation.
* **Data Modeling**: Choosing the correct structure (Arrays vs. Nodes) for specific problems.
* **Clean Code**: Adopting professional Java conventions and modular architecture.


## 📅 7-Day Roadmap & Progress
- [x] Day 1: Arrays - Search, Insertion, Deletion, and Traversal logic. ✅ ![Proof](docs/arrays_run.jpg)
- [x] Day 2: Singly Linked Lists - Node class, Beginning/End insertion, and Display. ✅ ![Proof](docs/linkedlists_run.jpg)
- [x] Day 3: Stacks - Implementing LIFO logic using Linked Lists (Push, Pop, Peek). ✅ ![Proof](docs/stacks_run.jpg)
✅ Day 4: Queues - Implementing FIFO logic using Linked Lists (Enqueue, Dequeue). ![Proof](docs/queues_run.jpg)
✅ Day 5: Searching algorithms - linear search, binary search. : Sorting Algorithms - Bubble, Selection, Merge, and Quick Sort. ![Search Proof](docs/searching_run.jpg) ![Sort Proof](docs/sorting_run.jpg)
             : Sorting Algorithms - Bubble, Selection, Merge, and Quick Sort.
✅ Day 6: Trees (Binary Tree) - Node logic and In-order, Pre-order, Post-order traversals. ![Proof](docs/trees_run.jpg)
- [ ] Day 7: Graph Basics - Adjacency lists and BFS/DFS traversal logic.
