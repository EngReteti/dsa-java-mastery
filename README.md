# My CS Journey @ CUK 🇰🇪

Welcome to my first GitHub repository! I am **Amason Lerionka Reteti**, a Computer Science student at The Co-operative University of Kenya. This is where I document my learning process, from writing my first lines of code to exploring complex systems.

### 📚 What I'm Learning
* **Programming:** Building logic with Java (Ask me about my Pharmacy Inventory project!).
* **Data Structures:** Learning how to make code fast and efficient.
* **Networking:** Exploring how computers talk to each other via sockets.
* **Web Design:** Creating responsive layouts using HTML, CSS, and JS.

### 🌱 Current Goal
I'm currently a "GitHub Explorer," learning how to use version control to collaborate and share my technical mini-projects with the world.
